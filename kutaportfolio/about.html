			<p>I have in my earlier years of college been an enthusiast in Mathematics especially in the sequence of applied Statistics and Actuarial Science.
				Finding my passion has been a way of discovering myself outside the realm of academia. With the growth in the digital industry and online prowess
				i have come to realised that aside from limited passions, i could actually digress in my thought and adapt the ever growing online  community by
				sharing my works on a platform that could be design and build by me. I developed interest in website design not long ago in the the Spring 20' semester
				and its amazing how far i have become in this new found descipline/passion. Aside from these, i am thrilled to listening to Gospel songs, reading and playing
				soccer. Some of my days are partly spent in the Milner Library of ISU.
